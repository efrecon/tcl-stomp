The Tcl STOMP library implements the an almost complete STOMP v1.2
client library, together with all the necessary buiding blocks for
sending and/or receiving STOMP messages in clients and server.  A sub
package implement all messaging (in and out) support, while the main
package provides for a utility layer allowing callers to send and
receive STOMP messages to/from servers with little effort.

The messaging layer provides the following core facilities:

* Procedures to create messages, set and get their various parameters
  and components.  Messages are composed of a command (as specified in
  STOMP), a set of headers (loosely similar to HTTP headers) and a
  body.  It is possible to strictly follow the message constraints as
  imposed by the protocol, i.e. control which header are mandatory and
  optional for a given command.

* Procedures to send and receive messages to and from a STOMP server.
  Reception is implemented via a "reader" context as messages can
  arrive at any time from a server on a socket.  The reader context
  contains a handler that will be called once incoming messages have
  been parsed and validated.

* Procedures "entertain" a connection towards a server.  One procedure
  ensures that keep-alive (almost) empty data is sent at regular
  intervals. Another watches that a remote servers continuously sends
  heart-beats at regular intervals, and provide a callback whenever it
  is deemed to have disconnected.

The STOMP layer encapsulates all traffic to a remote server into a
single object.  The layer provides an implementation that follows the
v1.2 of the specification, except that it does not directly offers
support for transactions.  The library offers the following core
facilities:

* Opening of connection to a remote server, while respecting the
  initial connection hand-shake that will establish how heart-beats
  will be exchange between the client and the server.

* Facilities to keep the connection alive at all time and as most as
  possible by continuously attempting to reconnect whenever the
  connection has been lost.

* Ability to provide callbacks to follow the current state of the
  connection (in progress, connected, disconnecting, etc.).

* Ability to be notified of the reception of any message.

* Ability to send messages to the remote end, thus providing a
  high-level wrapper around the messaging library, a wrapper that will
  take care of reconnections, header assignments, etc.

* Ability to subscribe to data coming from the server and to arrange
  for callbacks to be delivered each time a message matching the
  subscription is received from the server.  Subscriptions can be
  ended at all time, in cooperation with the server.

* Ability to request for receipts and to be called back on reception
  of the receipt.

* Perform graceful disconnections from the server, i.e. disconnections
  in cooperation with the server.
